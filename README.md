# Warning: Please run the windows version with proton if you want GPU acceleration on linux/mac

Chromium webgl functionality highly experimental on linux/mac (especially when using the wayland backend). See [this issue](https://github.com/Gzh0821/pvzg_site/issues/85)

If you're using wine wayland driver, you might need to start the .exe with `--in-process-gpu` for it to work properly.

# Audio issue

Sound effects tend to not work with default settings, open up settings and set `Audio Load Mode` to `DOM`
